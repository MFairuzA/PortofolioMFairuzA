                <p>December 2023 - February 2024</p>

                <p>SafeFlare is a mobile app built using flutter to help prevent the spread of wildfire before it causes a lot of destruction for the people around them. And it uses IOT technology to show an accurate data of a possible wildfire spread in order to properly warn the local about a potential wildfire. <br><br>
                In line with SDG's number 3 (good health and well beings), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land). We hope to help prevent massive land destruction and unnecessary health risk caused by these wildfires. <br><br>
                This is a project that I worked on with the team for the purpose of participating in the HACKFEST held by GDSC Indonesia even though here I am only a hipster, which is more helpful at the UI / UX stage with my friend as a hacker or making a mobile application using the flutter programming language.</p>

                <p>Doing a team Software Engineering project where we were given a Traveling theme to create a website. After a long discussion, our team came up with an idea to create a car rental website to make it easier for users to book car rental services with various types of cars available, both cars and buses, we call this website “TravelHolic!”. Using several technologies such as VSCode as a place for us to create and edit code, using javascript programming language with existing frameworks such as express.js and node.js, Figma to create an initial web design before coding, as well as technologies such as Postman for server debugging, railway and also cyclic to connect the back end to the front end of the website that we created. <br> <br>
                Here I became the Project Leader.</p>
